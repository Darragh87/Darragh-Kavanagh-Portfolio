## Porfolio owner goals

The main reason to create this website is to help me to get hired into a new career.
The page highlight's the owner in there best light. Showcasing there skills and work history.
Recruiter's can messgage to get on touch.

## User goals

### New user goals:
- new users are able to read my portfolio and pervious work history.
- new users can easily locate my home page, my resume page and my contact page.

### Returning user goals
- returning users can see new course that has been completed by the owner.
- returning users can send a private message using the contact form.

## User stories

### As a newly qualified Full stack Devoloper:
* I would like to present myself in the best light.

* To show that I have alot of transerable skills.

## Structure of the Porfolio

The Portfolio is easy and user-friendly on all devies. It showcases a picture of myself, 
a brief introduction on myself all on the first page. The second page would be my education
and work history. And the last page users could contact me if the would like to hire myself 
or if they are interested in going for an interview.

## Wifreframe

I used Balsamiq Wireframes to create my wireframes.
